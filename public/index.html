		Finding your dream job is much more then just finding the right job advert; it is about the company and the people working there. Will you be happy working with them, or are they very different from you? Does the company have the same focus as you? Will you form a good match? 
		<br />
		<br />
		These things are of-course still very difficult to figure out and we won't pretend to have the answers for you, but we do believe that we can give you a head start in finding answers to these questions yourself.
		<br />
		<br />
		Make better decisions, be happy!
