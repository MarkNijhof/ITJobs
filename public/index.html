		What if we would tell you; "Hey, this company that you are looking at would be a very good match for you, you would fit right in with the other people", wouldn't that be nice information to have? Or perhaps something like; "The position at this company you are looking at now may not make you happy, what about this other position they have here?".
		<br />
		<br />
		Or for employers we tell them; "This candidate is spending quite a bit of time committing to his OSS project which is using the same technology as you are using", that would make him/her more attractive wouldn't it? 
		<br />
		<br />
		We want to help you make better choices!
